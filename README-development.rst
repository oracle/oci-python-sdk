Development
============

Getting Started
===============
Assuming that you have Python and `virtualenv` installed, set up your environment and install the required dependencies like this:

.. code-block:: sh

    git clone https://github.com/oracle/oci-python-sdk.git
    cd oci-python-sdk
    virtualenv oci-python-sdk-env
    . oci-python-sdk-env/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    pip install -e .

You should also set up your configuration files as described `here`__

__ https://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/Content/API/Concepts/sdkconfig.htm

Running Tests
=============
The SDK uses `pytest` as its test framework. You can run tests against Python 2.7, Python 3.5 and Python 3.6 using the `tox` command. Note that this requires that you have those versions of Python installed,
otherwise you must pass `-e` or run tests directly:

.. code-block:: sh

    # This will run tests against all configured Pythons in tox.ini (currently 2.7, 3.5 and 3.6). You need to have those versions installed
    tox

    # This will run tests against a specific Python versions
    tox -e py27

If you wish to run an individual test then you can run:

.. code-block:: sh

    py.test -s tests/integ/test_launch_instance_tutorial.py

Specifying a config file
------------------------

By default, the tests will look for a config file, 'config' in 'tests/resources'.
If 'tests/resources' does not exist, the tests will try attempt to use
'tests/configuration/config'.
The default profile is ``DEFAULT``.  You can change this with the
``--config-file`` and ``--config-profile`` options.

.. code-block:: sh

    # Use a different config file, still using the DEFAULT profile
    tox -- --config-file ~/.oci/config

    # Using a different profile in the default config file
    tox -- --config-profile IAD_PROFILE

A sample config file is provided 'tests/configuration/config.sample'

Specifying environment variables
--------------------------------
In addition to a valid config file for your tenancy, the tests also require the following environment
variables to be set:

    * ``OCI_PYSDK_PUBLIC_SSH_KEY_FILE``: path to a public SSH key (.pub file) that will be given access to the instance launched in ``test_launch_instance_tutorial.py``.

Generating Documentation
========================
Sphinx is used for documentation. You can generate HTML locally with the following:

.. code-block:: sh

    pip install -r requirements.txt
    cd docs
    make html

Generating the wheel
====================
The SDK is packaged as a wheel. In order to generate the wheel you can run:

.. code-block:: sh

    python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel

This wheel can then be installed via `pip`.
