Pagination
~~~~~~~~~~~~
When you call a list operation (for example :py:func:`~oci.core.compute_client.ComputeClient.list_instances`) will retrieve a page of results. In order
to retrieve more data, you have to continue to make calls to the list operation, passing in the value of the most recent response's ``next_page`` attribute 
as a parameter to the next list operation call.

As a convenience over manually writing pagination code, you can make use of the functions in the :py:mod:`~oci.pagination` module to:

* Eagerly load all possible results from a list call
* Eagerly load all results from a list call up to a given limit
* Lazily load results (either all results, or up to a given limit) from a list call via a generator. These generators can yield either values/models or the raw response from calling the list operation

For an example on how to use these functions, please check `GitHub <https://github.com/oracle/oci-python-sdk/blob/master/examples/pagination.py>`_. More details about the API is `here <https://oracle-cloud-infrastructure-python-sdk.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/pagination.html>`_.
