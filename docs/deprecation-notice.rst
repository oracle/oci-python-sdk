Deprecation Notice
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
.. warning::
    Python 2.x has reached the end of its life on January 1st, 2020. If you still use Python 2.x, please upgrade your Python version -- Python 2.x is no longer maintained, nor supported by the OCI Python SDK.

    Community support for Python 2.x has ended on January 1st, 2020. Oracle OCI Python SDK depends on community supported packages and therefore has also ended support for Python 2.x. Bug fixes and enhancements do not take Python 2.x compatibility into consideration.

.. warning::
    This domain is deprecated and will no longer be maintained starting March 2018.

    Please access the documentation through our new location `here <https://oracle-cloud-infrastructure-python-sdk.readthedocs.io/>`_.
