Using FIPS-validated Libraries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The SDK can be configured to use FIPS-validated libcrypto library. You can set it programmatically on a per session basis or persistently across the environment. Both approaches require the path to the libcrypto library on your system.

Enabling FIPS Mode Programmatically
------------------------------------

To configure the SDK to use a FIPS-validated libcrypto library, execute the following:

.. code-block:: python

    oci.fips.enable_fips_mode('</path/to/libcrypto.x.x.x>')

Setting the Environment Variables
---------------------------------

If you do not want to run ``enable_fips_mode()`` for every session, you can set an environment variable so that the SDK uses the library every time.

Set the following environment variable to the path to the libcrypto library:

- FIPS_LIBCRYPTO_PATH

Verifying the Configuration
---------------------------

To verify that the SDK is using the libcrypto library that you specified, execute the following:

.. code-block:: python

    oci.fips.is_fips_mode()

This should return True, indicating that the SDK is using the library specified by the environment variable.
