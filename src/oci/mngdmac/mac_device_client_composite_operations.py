    This class provides a wrapper around :py:class:`~oci.mngdmac.MacDeviceClient` and offers convenience methods
    for operations that would otherwise need to be chained together. For example, instead of performing an action
    on a resource (e.g. launching an instance, creating a load balancer) and then using a waiter to wait for the resource
    to enter a given state, you can call a single method in this class to accomplish the same functionality
