    A file system snapshot policy is used to automate snapshot creation and deletion.

    To use any of the API operations, you must be authorized in an IAM policy. If you're not authorized, talk to an administrator. If you're an administrator who needs to write policies to give users access, see `Getting Started with Policies`__.
