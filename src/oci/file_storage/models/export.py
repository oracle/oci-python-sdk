class Export(object):
    """
    A file system and the path that you can use to mount it. Each export
    resource belongs to exactly one export set.

    The export's path attribute is not a path in the
    referenced file system, but the value used by clients for the path
    component of the remotetarget argument when mounting the file
    system.

    The path must start with a slash (/) followed by a sequence of zero or more
    slash-separated path elements. For any two export resources associated with
    the same export set, except those in a 'DELETED' state, the path element
    sequence for the first export resource can't contain the
    complete path element sequence of the second export resource.


    For example, the following are acceptable:

    * /example and /path
    * /example1 and /example2
    * /example and /example1

    The following examples are not acceptable:
    * /example and /example/path
    * / and /example

    Paths may not end in a slash (/). No path element can be a period (.)
    or two periods in sequence (..). All path elements must be 255 bytes or less.

    No two non-'DELETED' export resources in the same export set can
    reference the same file system.

    Use `exportOptions` to control access to an export. For more information, see
    `Export Options`__.

    **Warning:** Oracle recommends that you avoid using any confidential information when you supply string values using the API.
