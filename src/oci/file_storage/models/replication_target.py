class ReplicationTarget(object):
    """
    Replication targets are associated with a primary resource called a :class:`Replication`
    located in another availability domain in the same or different region.
    The replication retrieves the delta of data between two snapshots of a source file system
    and sends it to the associated `ReplicationTarget`,  which applies it to the target
    file system.
    All operations (except `DELETE`) must be done using the associated replication resource.
    Deleting a `ReplicationTarget` allows the target file system to be exported.
    Deleting a `ReplicationTarget` does not delete the associated `Replication` resource, but places it in a `FAILED` state.
    For more information, see `File System Replication`__.
