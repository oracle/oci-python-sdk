    Dedicated AI clusters are compute resources that you can use for fine-tuning custom models or for hosting endpoints for custom models. The clusters are dedicated to your models and not shared with users in other tenancies.

    To use any of the API operations, you must be authorized in an IAM policy. If you're not authorized, talk to an administrator who gives OCI resource access to users. See
