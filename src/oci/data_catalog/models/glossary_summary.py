    Summary of a glossary. A glossary of business terms, such as 'Customer', 'Account', 'Contact', 'Address',
    or 'Product', with definitions, used to provide common meaning across disparate data assets. Business glossaries
    may be hierarchical where some terms may contain child terms to allow them to be used as 'taxonomies'.
    By linking data assets, data entities, and attributes to glossaries and glossary terms, the glossary can act as a
    way of organizing data catalog objects in a hierarchy to make a large number of objects more navigable and easier to
    consume. Objects in the data catalog, such as data assets or data entities, may be linked to any level in the
    glossary, so that the glossary can be used to browse the available data according to the business model of the
    organization.
