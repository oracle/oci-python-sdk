        execution may define it's set of required and optional properties. The map keys are category names and the

        job executions have required properties within the \"default\" category.
        Example: `{\"properties\": { \"default\": { \"host\": \"host1\", \"port\": \"1521\", \"database\": \"orcl\"}}}`
