class TimeoutConnectionAndServiceErrorRetryChecker(BaseRetryChecker):
    """
    A checker which will retry on certain exceptions. Retries are enabled for the following exception types:

        - Timeouts from the requests library (we will always retry on these)
        - ConnectionErrors from the requests library (we will always retry on these)
        - Built-in ConnectionErrors from Python 3
        - Service errors where the status is 500 or above (i.e. a server-side error, except 501)
        - Service errors where a status (e.g. 429) and, optionally, the code meet a given criteria

    The last item is configurable via dictionary where the key is some numeric status representing a HTTP status and the value
    is a list of strings with each string representing a textual error code (such as those error codes documented at
    https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/API/References/apierrors.htm). If an empty list is provided, then
    only the numeric status is checked for retry purposes. For a populated array, we are looking for where the numeric status matches
    and the code from the exception appears in the array. As an example:

    .. code-block:: python

        {
            400: ['QuotaExceeded'],
            500: []
        }

    If no configuration is provided, then the default for service errors is to retry on HTTP 409/IncorrectState, 429's and 5xx's (except 501) without any
    code checks. If a specific 5xx code (e.g. 500, 502) is provided in the dictionary, then it takes precedence over the option to retry on any 500, for example,
    it is possible to retry on only 502s (either by status or by status and matching some code) by disabling the general "retry on any 5xx"
    configuration and placing an entry for 502 in the dictionary
