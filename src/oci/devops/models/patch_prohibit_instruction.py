    A precondition operation that requires a selection to be empty, or optionally to be non-empty but include no item with a specified value
    (useful for asserting that a value does not exist before attempting to create it, avoiding accidental update).
    It fails if value is provided and the selection includes an item matching it, or if value is not provided and the selection is not empty,
