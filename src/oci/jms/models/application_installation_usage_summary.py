class ApplicationInstallationUsageSummary(object):
    """
    Summarizes application installation usage information during a specified time period. The main difference between ApplicationUsage and ApplicationInstallationUsageSummary is the presence of installation information. ApplicationUsage provides only aggregated information for an application regardless of the installation paths. Therefore, two different applications with the same application name installed in two different paths will be aggregated to a single application. This aggregation makes it difficult to focus actions to single application installed on a known path.
    An application installation is independent of the Java Runtime on which it's running or the Managed Instance where it's installed.
