        For DNSSEC to function, every parent zone in the DNS tree up to the top-level domain (or an independent
        trust anchor) must also have DNSSEC correctly set up.
        After enabling DNSSEC, you must add a DS record to the zone's parent zone containing the
        `KskDnssecKeyVersion` data. You can find the DS data in the `dsData` attribute of the `KskDnssecKeyVersion`.
        Then, use the `PromoteZoneDnssecKeyVersion` operation to promote the `KskDnssecKeyVersion`.

        New `KskDnssecKeyVersion`s are generated annually, a week before the existing `KskDnssecKeyVersion`'s expiration.
        To rollover a `KskDnssecKeyVersion`, you must replace the parent zone's DS record containing the old
        `KskDnssecKeyVersion` data with the data from the new `KskDnssecKeyVersion`.

        To remove the old DS record without causing service disruption, wait until the old DS record's TTL has
        expired, and the new DS record has propagated. After the DS replacement has been completed, then the
        `PromoteZoneDnssecKeyVersion` operation must be called.

        Metrics are emitted in the `oci_dns` namespace daily for each `KskDnssecKeyVersion` indicating how many
        days are left until expiration.
        We recommend that you set up alarms and notifications for KskDnssecKeyVersion expiration so that the
        necessary parent zone updates can be made and the `PromoteZoneDnssecKeyVersion` operation can be called.

        Enabling DNSSEC results in additional records in DNS responses which increases their size and can
