    The configuration of the sorting and filtering behaviors in a steering policy. Rules can
    filter and sort answers based on weight, priority, endpoint health, and other data.


    A rule may optionally include a sequence of cases, each with an optional `caseCondition`
    expression. Cases allow a sequence of conditions to be defined that will apply different
    parameters to the rule when the conditions are met. For more information about cases,
    see `Traffic Management API Guide`__.

        **[Required]** Gets the rule_type of this SteeringPolicyRule.

          only if their `shouldKeep` value is `true`.


        * `HEALTH` - Removes answers from the list if their `rdata` matches a target in the
          health check monitor referenced by the steering policy and the target is reported down.


        * `WEIGHTED` - Uses a number between 0 and 255 to determine how often an answer will be served
          in relation to other answers. Anwers with a higher weight will be served more frequently.


        * `PRIORITY` - Uses a defined rank value of answers to determine which answer to serve,
          moving those with the lowest values to the beginning of the list without changing the
          relative order of those with the same value. Answers can be given a value between `0` and `255`.


        * `LIMIT` - Filters answers that are too far down the list. Parameter `defaultCount`
          specifies how many answers to keep. **Example:** If `defaultCount` has a value of `2` and
          there are five answers left, when the `LIMIT` rule is processed, only the first two answers
