        What must precede the LIMIT rule is determined by the template value:
        - FAILOVER requires exactly an unconditional PRIORITY rule that ranks answers by pool.
          Each answer pool must have a unique priority value assigned to it. Answer data must
          be defined in the `defaultAnswerData` property for the rule and the `cases` property
          must not be defined.

          by name. Answer data must be defined in the `defaultAnswerData` property for the
          rule and the `cases` property must not be defined.
        - ROUTE_BY_GEO requires exactly one PRIORITY rule that ranks answers by pool using the
          geographical location of the client as a condition. Within that rule you may only
          use `query.client.geoKey` in the `caseCondition` expressions for defining the cases.
          For each case in the PRIORITY rule each answer pool must have a unique priority
          value assigned to it. Answer data can only be defined within cases and
          `defaultAnswerData` cannot be used in the PRIORITY rule.
        - ROUTE_BY_ASN requires exactly one PRIORITY rule that ranks answers by pool using the
          ASN of the client as a condition. Within that rule you may only use
          `query.client.asn` in the `caseCondition` expressions for defining the cases.
          For each case in the PRIORITY rule each answer pool must have a unique priority
          value assigned to it. Answer data can only be defined within cases and
          `defaultAnswerData` cannot be used in the PRIORITY rule.
        - ROUTE_BY_IP requires exactly one PRIORITY rule that ranks answers by pool using the
          IP subnet of the client as a condition. Within that rule you may only use
          `query.client.address` in the `caseCondition` expressions for defining the cases.
          For each case in the PRIORITY rule each answer pool must have a unique priority
          value assigned to it. Answer data can only be defined within cases and
          `defaultAnswerData` cannot be used in the PRIORITY rule.
