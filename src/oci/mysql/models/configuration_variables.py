            Both RO and RW transactions do not wait for preceding transactions to be applied before executing.
            A RW transaction does not wait for other members to apply a transaction. This means that a transaction
            could be externalized on one member before the others. This also means that in the event of a primary failover,
            the new primary can accept new RO and RW transactions before the previous primary transactions are all applied.
            RO transactions could result in outdated values, RW transactions could result in a rollback due to conflicts.
        - BEFORE_ON_PRIMARY_FAILOVER:
            New RO or RW transactions with a newly elected primary that is applying backlog from the old
            primary are held (not applied) until any backlog has been applied. This ensures that when a primary failover happens,
            intentionally or not, clients always see the latest value on the primary. This guarantees consistency, but means that
            clients must be able to handle the delay in the event that a backlog is being applied. Usually this delay should be minimal,
            but does depend on the size of the backlog.
        - BEFORE:
            A RW transaction waits for all preceding transactions to complete before being applied. A RO transaction waits for all preceding
            transactions to complete before being executed. This ensures that this transaction reads the latest value by only affecting the
            latency of the transaction. This reduces the overhead of synchronization on every RW transaction, by ensuring synchronization is
            used only on RO transactions. This consistency level also includes the consistency guarantees provided by BEFORE_ON_PRIMARY_FAILOVER.

            A RW transaction waits until its changes have been applied to all of the other members. This value has no effect on RO transactions.
            This mode ensures that when a transaction is committed on the local member, any subsequent transaction reads the written value or
            a more recent value on any group member. Use this mode with a group that is used for predominantly RO operations to ensure that
            applied RW transactions are applied everywhere once they commit. This could be used by your application to ensure that subsequent
            reads fetch the latest data which includes the latest writes. This reduces the overhead of synchronization on every RO transaction,

        the thread pool plugin does not load and the server writes a message to the error log.

        threadPoolSize corresponds to the MySQL Server System variable
