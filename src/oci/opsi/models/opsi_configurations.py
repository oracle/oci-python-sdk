    An OPSI configuration resource is a container for storing custom values for customizable configuration items exposed by Operations Insights.

    Operations Insights exposes different sets of customizable configuration items through different OPSI configuration types.
    UX_CONFIGURATION: OPSI configuration resource of this type can be created only once in each compartment. It is a compartment level singleton resource.

    When configuration values, for an OPSI configuration type that supports compartment level singleton (e.g: UX_CONFIGURATION) resource, are queried for a compartment,
    following will be the order of preference.
    1. If the specified compartment has an OPSI configuration resource, first preference will be given to the custom values inside that.
    2. If the root compartment has an OPSI configuration resource, it will be considered as applicable to all compartments of that tenency,
    hence second preference will be given to the custom values inside that.
    3. Default configuration will be considered as a final fallback option.
