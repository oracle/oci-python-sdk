    Details to create a new sensitive data model. If schemas and sensitive types are provided, it automatically runs
    data discovery and adds the discovered columns to the sensitive data model. Otherwise, it creates an empty sensitive
    data model that can be updated later.
    To specify some schemas and sensitive types for data discovery, use schemasForDiscovery and sensitiveTypeIdsForDiscovery
    attributes. But if you want to include all schemas and sensitive types, you can set isIncludeAllSchemas and
    isIncludeAllSensitiveTypes attributes to true. In the latter case, you do not need to list all schemas and
