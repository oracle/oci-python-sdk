    """
    The Deterministic Encryption masking format encrypts column data using a cryptographic
    key and Advanced Encryption Standard (AES 128). It can be used to encrypt character and
    number columns. It can encrypt ASCII data without any input (except seed value), but it
    needs a regular expression to encrypt non-ASCII data.

    Deterministic Encryption is a format-preserving, deterministic and reversible masking
    format, which requires a seed value while submitting a masking work request. Passing
    the same seed value when masking multiple times or masking different databases ensures
    that the data is masked deterministically. To learn more, check Deterministic Encryption
    in the Data Safe documentation.

        Gets the regular_expression of this DeterministicEncryptionFormatEntry.
        The regular expression to be used for masking. For data with characters in the
        ASCII character set, providing a regular expression is optional. However, it
        is required if the data contains multi-byte characters. If not provided, an
        error is returned when a multi-byte character is found.

        In the case of ASCII characters, if a regular expression is not provided,
        Deterministic Encryption can encrypt variable-length column values while
        preserving their original format.

        If a regular expression is provided, the column values in all the rows must match
        the regular expression. Deterministic Encryption supports a subset of the regular
        expression language. It supports encryption of fixed-length strings, and does not
        support * or + syntax of regular expressions. The encrypted values also match the
        regular expression, which helps to ensure that the original format is preserved.
        If an original value does not match the regular expression, Deterministic Encryption
        might not produce a one-to-one mapping. All non-confirming values are mapped to a
        single encrypted value, thereby producing a many-to-one mapping.
