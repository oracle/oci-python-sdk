          For more examples, see

        listed in the condition. Field names must appear in the condition with the same nesting
        structure used in the event.

          For a list of reference events, see
        `Services that Produce Events`__.
        * Rules apply to events in the compartment in which you create them and any child compartments.
        This means that a condition specified by a rule only matches events emitted from resources in
        the compartment or any of its child compartments.
        * Wildcard matching is supported with the asterisk (*) character.

          For examples of wildcard matching, see
