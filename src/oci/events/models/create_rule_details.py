        * Fields not mentioned in the condition are ignored. You can create a valid filter that matches

          For more examples, see
        `Matching Events with Filters`__.
        * For a condition with fields to match an event, the event must contain all the field names
        listed in the condition. Field names must appear in the condition with the same nesting
        structure used in the event.

          For a list of reference events, see
        `Services that Produce Events`__.
        * Rules apply to events in the compartment in which you create them and any child compartments.
        This means that a condition specified by a rule only matches events emitted from resources in
        the compartment or any of its child compartments.
        * Wildcard matching is supported with the asterisk (*) character.

          For examples of wildcard matching, see
        `Matching Events with Filters`__
