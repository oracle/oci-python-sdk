    This class provides a wrapper around :py:class:`~oci.audit.AuditClient` and offers convenience methods

    on a resource (e.g. launching an instance, creating a load balancer) and then using a waiter to wait for the resource
    to enter a given state, you can call a single method in this class to accomplish the same functionality
