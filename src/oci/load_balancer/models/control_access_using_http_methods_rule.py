    An object that represents the action of returning a specified response code when the requested HTTP method is not in
    the list of allowed methods for the listener. The load balancer does not forward a disallowed request to the back end
    servers. The default response code is `405 Method Not Allowed`.

    If you set the response code to `405` or leave it blank, the system adds an \"allow\" response header that contains a
    list of the allowed methods for the listener. If you set the response code to anything other than `405` (or blank),
    the system does not add the \"allow\" response header with a list of allowed methods.

    This rule applies only to HTTP listeners. No more than one `ControlAccessUsingHttpMethodsRule` object can be present in
    a given listener.
