        **[Required]** Gets the idle_timeout of this ConnectionConfiguration.
        The maximum idle time, in seconds, allowed between two successive receive or two successive send operations
        between the client and backend servers. A send operation does not reset the timer for receive operations. A
        receive operation does not reset the timer for send operations.

        The default values are:

        *  300 seconds for TCP

        *  60 seconds for HTTP and WebSocket protocols.

        Note: The protocol is set at the listener.

        Modify this parameter if the client or backend server stops transmitting data for more than the default time.
        Some examples include:

        *  The client sends a database query to the backend server and the database takes over 300 seconds to execute.
           Therefore, the backend server does not transmit any data within 300 seconds.

        *  The client uploads data using the HTTP protocol. During the upload, the backend does not transmit any data
           to the client for more than 60 seconds.

        *  The client downloads data using the HTTP protocol.  After the initial request, it stops transmitting data to
           the backend server for more than 60 seconds.

        *  The client starts transmitting data after establishing a WebSocket connection, but the backend server does
           not transmit data for more than 60 seconds.

        *  The backend server starts transmitting data after establishing a WebSocket connection, but the client does
           not transmit data for more than 60 seconds.

        The maximum value is 7200 seconds. Contact My Oracle Support to file a service request if you want to increase
        this limit for your tenancy. For more information, see `Service Limits`__.
