class RedirectUri(object):
    """
    An object that defines the redirect URI applied to the original request. The object property values compose the
    redirect URI.

    **NOTE:** The Load Balancing service cannot automatically detect or avoid infinite redirects. Be sure to provide
    meaningful, complete, and correct field values. If any component field of this object has no value, the system
    retains the value from the incoming HTTP request URI.

    For example, if you specify only the protocol field `https`, and the incoming request URI is
    `http://example.com:8080`, the resulting runtime redirect URI is `https://example.com:8080`. The system retains
    the host and port from the incoming URI and does not automatically change the port setting from `8080` to `443`.

    Be sure to configure valid percent-encoding (URL encoding) when needed.

    In addition to static string values, you can use the following tokens to construct the redirect URI. These tokens
    extract values from the incoming HTTP request URI.

    *  {protocol} : The protocol from the incoming HTTP request URI.
    *  {host}     : The domain name from the incoming HTTP request URI.
    *  {port}     : The port from the incoming HTTP request URI.
    *  {path}     : The path from the incoming HTTP request URI.
    *  {query}    : The query string from the incoming HTTP request URI.

    The tokens are case sensitive. For example, `{host}` is a valid token, but `{HOST}` is not.

    You can retain the literal characters of a token when you specify values for the path and query properties of the
    redirect URI. Use a backslash (\\\\) as the escape character for the \\\\, {, and } characters. For example, if the
    incoming HTTP request URI is `/video`, the path property value:

    `/example{path}123\\{path\\}`

    appears in the constructed redirect URI as:

    `/example/video123{path}`
