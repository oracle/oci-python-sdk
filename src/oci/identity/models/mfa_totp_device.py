    Users can enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) for their own user accounts. After MFA is enabled, the
    user is prompted for a time-based one-time password (TOTP) to authenticate before they can sign in to the
    Console. To enable multi-factor authentication, the user must register a mobile device with a TOTP authenticator app
    installed. The registration process creates the `MfaTotpDevice` object. The registration process requires
    interaction with the Console and cannot be completed programmatically. For more information, see
    `Managing Multi-Factor Authentication`__.
