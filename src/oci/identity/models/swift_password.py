    Swift is the OpenStack object storage service. A `SwiftPassword` is an Oracle-provided password for using a
    Swift client with the Object Storage Service. This password is associated with
    the user's Console login. Swift passwords never expire. A user can have up to two Swift passwords at a time.

    **Note:** The password is always an Oracle-generated string; you can't change it to a string of your choice.
