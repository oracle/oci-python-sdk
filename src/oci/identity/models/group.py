    A collection of users who all need the same type of access to a particular set of resources or compartment.
    For conceptual information about groups and other IAM Service components, see
    `Overview of IAM`__.

    If you're federating with an identity provider (IdP), you need to create mappings between the groups
    defined in the IdP and groups you define in the IAM service. For more information, see
    `Identity Providers and Federation`__. Also see
    :class:`IdentityProvider` and
    :class:`IdpGroupMapping`.

    To use any of the API operations, you must be authorized in an IAM policy. If you're not authorized,
    talk to an administrator. If you're an administrator who needs to write policies to give users access,
    see `Get Started with Policies`__.

    **Warning:** Oracle recommends that you avoid using any confidential information when you supply string values
    using the API.
