    """
    A virtual network interface card. Each VNIC resides in a subnet in a VCN.
    An instance attaches to a VNIC to obtain a network connection into the VCN
    through that subnet. Each instance has a *primary VNIC* that is automatically
    created and attached during launch. You can add *secondary VNICs* to an
    instance after it's launched. For more information, see
    `Virtual Network Interface Cards (VNICs)`__.

    Each VNIC has a *primary private IP* that is automatically assigned during launch.
    You can add *secondary private IPs* to a VNIC after it's created. For more
    information, see :func:`create_private_ip` and
    `IP Addresses`__.


    If you are an Oracle Cloud VMware Solution customer, you will have secondary VNICs
    that reside in a VLAN instead of a subnet. These VNICs have other differences, which
    are called out in the descriptions of the relevant attributes in the `Vnic` object.
    Also see :class:`Vlan`.

    To use any of the API operations, you must be authorized in an IAM policy. If you're not authorized,
    talk to an administrator. If you're an administrator who needs to write policies to give users access, see
    `Getting Started with Policies`__.
