    An operation that \"puts\" a value, replacing every item of the selection with it, or creating it if the selection is empty.
    NOT_FOUND exceptions are handled by creating the implied containing structure (but note that this may put the target in an invalid state,
    which can be prevented by use of precondition operations).
    To avoid referential errors if an item's descendant is also in the selection, items of the selection are processed in order of decreasing depth.
