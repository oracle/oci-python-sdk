    For use with Oracle Cloud Infrastructure FastConnect. A cross-connect represents a
    physical connection between an existing network and Oracle. Customers who are colocated
    with Oracle in a FastConnect location create and use cross-connects. For more
    information, see `FastConnect Overview`__.

    Oracle recommends you create each cross-connect in a
    :class:`CrossConnectGroup` so you can use link aggregation
    with the connection.

    **Note:** If you're a provider who is setting up a physical connection to Oracle so customers
    can use FastConnect over the connection, be aware that your connection is modeled the
    same way as a colocated customer's (with `CrossConnect` and `CrossConnectGroup` objects, and so on).

    To use any of the API operations, you must be authorized in an IAM policy. If you're not authorized,
    talk to an administrator. If you're an administrator who needs to write policies to give users access, see
    `Getting Started with Policies`__.
