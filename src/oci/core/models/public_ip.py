        public IP must always be assigned to an entity. If the assigned entity is a private IP,
        the ephemeral public IP is automatically deleted when the private IP is deleted, when
        the VNIC is terminated, or when the instance is terminated. If the assigned entity is a
        :class:`NatGateway`, the ephemeral public IP is automatically
        deleted when the NAT gateway is terminated.

        * `RESERVED`: You control the public IP's lifetime. You can delete a reserved public IP
        whenever you like. It does not need to be assigned to a private IP at all times.

        For more information and comparison of the two types,
        see `Public IP Addresses`__.
