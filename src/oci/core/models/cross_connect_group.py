    For use with Oracle Cloud Infrastructure FastConnect. A cross-connect group
    is a link aggregation group (LAG), which can contain one or more
    :class:`CrossConnect`. Customers who are colocated with
    Oracle in a FastConnect location create and use cross-connect groups. For more
    information, see `FastConnect Overview`__.

    **Note:** If you're a provider who is setting up a physical connection to Oracle so customers
    can use FastConnect over the connection, be aware that your connection is modeled the
    same way as a colocated customer's (with `CrossConnect` and `CrossConnectGroup` objects, and so on).

    To use any of the API operations, you must be authorized in an IAM policy. If you're not authorized,
    talk to an administrator. If you're an administrator who needs to write policies to give users access, see
    `Getting Started with Policies`__.
