        Allowed values:

          * An IP address range in CIDR notation. For example: `192.168.1.0/24` or `2001:0db8:0123:45::/56`
            Note that IPv6 addressing is currently supported only in certain regions. See
            `IPv6 Addresses`__.

          * The `cidrBlock` value for a :class:`Service`, if you're
            setting up a security rule for traffic coming from a particular `Service` through
            a service gateway. For example: `oci-phx-objectstorage`.

          * The OCID of a :class:`NetworkSecurityGroup` in the same
            VCN. The value can be the NSG that the rule belongs to if the rule's intent is to control
            traffic between VNICs in the same NSG.
