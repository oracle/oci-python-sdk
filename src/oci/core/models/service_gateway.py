    Represents a router that lets your VCN privately access specific Oracle services such as Object
    Storage without exposing the VCN to the public internet. Traffic leaving the VCN and destined
    for a supported Oracle service (see :func:`list_services`) is
    routed through the service gateway and does not traverse the internet. The instances in the VCN
    do not need to have public IP addresses nor be in a public subnet. The VCN does not need an internet gateway
    for this traffic. For more information, see
    `Access to Oracle Services: Service Gateway`__.

    To use any of the API operations, you must be authorized in an IAM policy. If you're not authorized,
    talk to an administrator. If you're an administrator who needs to write policies to give users access, see
    `Getting Started with Policies`__.
