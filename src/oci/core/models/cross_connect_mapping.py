class CrossConnectMapping(object):
    """
    For use with Oracle Cloud Infrastructure FastConnect. Each
    :class:`VirtualCircuit` runs on one or
    more cross-connects or cross-connect groups. A `CrossConnectMapping`
    contains the properties for an individual cross-connect or cross-connect group
    associated with a given virtual circuit.

    The mapping includes information about the cross-connect or
    cross-connect group, the VLAN, and the BGP peering session.

    If you're a customer who is colocated with Oracle, that means you own both
    the virtual circuit and the physical connection it runs on (cross-connect or
    cross-connect group), so you specify all the information in the mapping. There's
    one exception: for a public virtual circuit, Oracle specifies the BGP IP
    addresses.

    If you're a provider, then you own the physical connection that the customer's
    virtual circuit runs on, so you contribute information about the cross-connect
    or cross-connect group and VLAN.

    Who specifies the BGP peering information in the case of customer connection via
    provider? If the BGP session goes from Oracle to the provider's edge router, then
    the provider also specifies the BGP peering information. If the BGP session instead
    goes from Oracle to the customer's edge router, then the customer specifies the BGP
    peering information. There's one exception: for a public virtual circuit, Oracle
    specifies the BGP IP addresses.
