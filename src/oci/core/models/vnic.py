    A virtual network interface card. Each VNIC resides in a subnet in a VCN.
    An instance attaches to a VNIC to obtain a network connection into the VCN
    through that subnet. Each instance has a *primary VNIC* that is automatically
    created and attached during launch. You can add *secondary VNICs* to an
    instance after it's launched. For more information, see
    `Virtual Network Interface Cards (VNICs)`__.

    Each VNIC has a *primary private IP* that is automatically assigned during launch.
    You can add *secondary private IPs* to a VNIC after it's created. For more
    information, see :func:`create_private_ip` and
    `IP Addresses`__.
