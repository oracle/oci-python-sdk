class VirtualCircuit(object):
    """
    For use with Oracle Cloud Infrastructure FastConnect.

    A virtual circuit is an isolated network path that runs over one or more physical
    network connections to provide a single, logical connection between the edge router
    on the customer's existing network and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. *Private*
    virtual circuits support private peering, and *public* virtual circuits support
    public peering. For more information, see `FastConnect Overview`__.

    Each virtual circuit is made up of information shared between a customer, Oracle,
    and a provider (if the customer is using FastConnect via a provider). Who fills in
    a given property of a virtual circuit depends on whether the BGP session related to
    that virtual circuit goes from the customer's edge router to Oracle, or from the provider's
    edge router to Oracle. Also, in the case where the customer is using a provider, values
    for some of the properties may not be present immediately, but may get filled in as the
    provider and Oracle each do their part to provision the virtual circuit.

    To use any of the API operations, you must be authorized in an IAM policy. If you're not authorized,
    talk to an administrator. If you're an administrator who needs to write policies to give users access, see
    `Getting Started with Policies`__.

    **Warning:** Oracle recommends that you avoid using any confidential information when you
    supply string values using the API.
