# This sample will create the VCN where the NAT Gateway will be created, and create the NAT Gateway that
# will be moved to a new compartment.  Cleanup of NAT gateway and VCN is performed after completion of
# the change compartment operation.
#
# This script takes the following arguments
#
#    * The OCID of the compartment where the NAT gateway and related resources will be created
#    * TThe OCID of the compartment where the NAT gateway will be moved to
#
# Usage :
#    change_nat_gateway_compartment_example.py --src-compartment-id=<src compartment OCID>
#                                           --dest-compartment-id=<dest compartment OCID>
