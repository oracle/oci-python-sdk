# Usage2ADW - Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Usage and Cost Reports to Autonomous Database Tool

## Introduction
usage2adw is a tool which uses the Python SDK to extract the usage and cost reports from your tenant and load it to Oracle Autonomous Database. (DbaaS can be used as well)
Authentication to OCI by User or instance principals.

## Usage Reports Overview
A usage report is a comma-separated value (CSV) file that can be used to get a detailed breakdown of resources in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure for audit or invoice reconciliation.

## How Usage Reports Work
The usage report is automatically generated daily, and is stored in an Oracle-owned Object Storage bucket. It contains one row per each Oracle Cloud Infrastructure resource (such as instance, Object Storage bucket, VNIC) per hour along with consumption information, metadata, and tags. Usage reports generally contain 24 hours of usage data, although occasionally a usage report may contain late-arriving data that is older than 24 hours.

Usage reports are retained for one year.

The file name for each usage report is appended with an automatically incrementing numerical value.

## Step by Step Installation Guide
Please check step by step guide - [step_by_step_installation.md](step_by_step_installation.md)


## OCI SDK Modules Included:
- oci.identity.IdentityClient            
- oci.object_storage.ObjectStorageClient 

## Database Tables:
- OCI_USAGE - Raw data of the usage reports
- OCI_USAGE_STATS - Summary Stats of the Usage Report for quick query if only filtered by tenant and date
- OCI_USAGE_TAG_KEYS - Tag keys of the usage reports
- OCI_COST - Raw data of the cost reports
- OCI_COST_STATS - Summary Stats of the Cost Report for quick query if only filtered by tenant and date
- OCI_COST_TAG_KEYS - Tag keys of the cost reports
- OCI_COST_REFERENCE - Reference table of the cost filter keys - SERVICE, REGION, COMPARTMENT, PRODUCT, SUBSCRIPTION
- OCI_PRICE_LIST - Hold the price list and the cost per product 

## OCI APIs Used:
- IdentityClient.list_compartments - Policy COMPARTMENT_INSPECT
- IdentityClient.get_tenancy       - Policy TENANCY_INSPECT
- ObjectStorageClient.list_objects - Policy OBJECT_INSPECT
- ObjectStorageClient.get_object   - Policy OBJECT_READ

## REST API Used:
- https://itra.oraclecloud.com/itas/.anon/myservices/api/v1/products?partNumber=XX

## Python 3 OCI SDK

### Installation of Python 3 incase you don't have Python3 installed:
Please follow Python Documentation - https://docs.python.org/3/using/index.html

### install oci SDK Packages:
Please follow Oracle Python SDK Documentation - https://github.com/oracle/oci-python-sdk

### install requests package:
pip install requests or pip3 install requests

## Setup connectivity using Instance Principals

```  
1. Login to your OCI Cloud console

2. Create new Dynamic Group : UsageDownloadGroup  
   Obtain Compute OCID and add rule - ALL {instance.id = 'ocid1.instance.oc1.xxxxxxxxxx'}

3. Create new Policy: UsageDownloadPolicy with Statements:
   define tenancy usage-report as ocid1.tenancy.oc1..aaaaaaaaned4fkpkisbwjlr56u7cj63lf3wffbilvqknstgtvzub7vhqkggq
   endorse dynamic-group UsageDownloadGroup to read objects in tenancy usage-report
   Allow dynamic-group UsageDownloadGroup to inspect compartments in tenancy
   Allow dynamic-group UsageDownloadGroup to inspect tenancies in tenancy
```

## Setup connectivity using Specific User

```  
1. Login to your OCI Cloud console

2. Create new group : UsageDownloadGroup  

3. Create new Policy: UsageDownloadPolicy with Statements: 
   define tenancy usage-report as ocid1.tenancy.oc1..aaaaaaaaned4fkpkisbwjlr56u7cj63lf3wffbilvqknstgtvzub7vhqkggq
   endorse group UsageDownloadGroup to read objects in tenancy usage-report
   Allow group UsageDownloadGroup to inspect compartments in tenancy
   Allow group UsageDownloadGroup to inspect tenancies in tenancy

4. Create new User  : UsageDownloadUser -> Add to UsageDownloadGroup group  

5. Config OCI config file - ~/.oci/config
   Please follow SDK config documentation - https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/API/Concepts/sdkconfig.htm 
```
## Setup Oracle Instant client in order to connect to DB/ADB 
- Download Oracle Instant client (base and tools) and follow the installation instructions - https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/instant-client/downloads.html

- Follow ADB wallet download at - https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Database/Tasks/adbconnecting.htm

- Test database connectivity using SQLPLUS - sqlplus duser/dpass@dname

## Copy the Software
Download the usage2adw.py from this project or clone the github project

Execute
