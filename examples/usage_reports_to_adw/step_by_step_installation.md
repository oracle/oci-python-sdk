# Usage2ADW - Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Usage and Cost Reports to Autonomous Database with APEX Reporting

## Step by Step Manual installation Guide on OCI VM and Autonomous Data Warehouse Database
usage2adw is a tool which uses the Python SDK to extract the usage reports from your tenant and load it to Oracle Autonomous Database.

Oracle Application Express (APEX) will be used for reporting.  

**DISCLAIMER â€“ This is not an official Oracle application,  It does not supported by Oracle Support, It should NOT be used for utilization calculation purposes, and rather OCI's official 
[cost analysis](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Billing/Concepts/costanalysisoverview.htm) 
and [usage reports](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Billing/Concepts/usagereportsoverview.htm) features should be used instead.**

## 1. Deploy VM Compute instance to run the python script
```
   OCI -> Menu -> Compute -> Instances
   Create Instance
   --> Name = UsageVM
   --> Image = Oracle Linux 8
   --> Shape = VM.Flex.E4 or Higher
   --> Choose your network VCN and Subnet (any type of VCN and Subnet)
   --> Assign public IP -  Optional if on public subnet
   --> Add your public SSH key
   --> Press Create
```

```
Copy Instance Info:
--> Compute OCID to be used for Dynamic Group Permission
--> Compute IP
```

## 2. Create Dynamic Group for Instance Principles

```
OCI -> Menu -> Identity -> Dynamic Groups -> Create Dynamic Group
--> Name = UsageDownloadGroup 
--> Desc = Dynamic Group for the Usage Report VM
--> Rule 1 = ANY { instance.id = 'OCID_Of_Step_1_Instance' }
```

## 3. Create Policy to allow the Dynamic Group to extract usage report and read Compartments

```
OCI -> Menu -> Identity -> Policies
Choose Root Compartment
Create Policy
--> Name = UsageDownloadPolicy
--> Desc = Allow Dynamic Group UsageDownloadGroup to Extract Usage report script
Statements:
define tenancy usage-report as ocid1.tenancy.oc1..aaaaaaaaned4fkpkisbwjlr56u7cj63lf3wffbilvqknstgtvzub7vhqkggq
endorse dynamic-group UsageDownloadGroup to read objects in tenancy usage-report
Allow dynamic-group UsageDownloadGroup to inspect compartments in tenancy
Allow dynamic-group UsageDownloadGroup to inspect tenancies in tenancy
Allow dynamic-group UsageDownloadGroup to read autonomous-databases in compartment {APPCOMP} 
*** Please don't change the usage report tenant OCID, it is fixed.
```

## 4. Deploy Autonomous Data Warehouse Database

```
OCI -> Menu -> Autonomous Data Warehouse
Create Autonomous Database
--> Compartment = Please Choose
--> Display Name = ADWCUSG
--> Database Name ADWCUSG
--> Workload = Data Warehouse
--> Deployment = Shared
--> Always Free = Optional
--> OCPU = 1
--> Storage = 1
--> Auto Scale = No
--> Password = We1lc2om3e#4 (Please choose your own password)
--> Choose Network Access = Allow secure Access from Everywhere (you can use VCN as well which requires NSG)
--> Choose License Type
```

## 5. Login to Linux Machine

```
Using the SSH key you provided, SSH to the linux machine from step #1
ssh opc@UsageVM
```

## 6. Run Install Packages Script from Github

The script will install Python3, Git and python packages - oci, oci-cli, oracledb and requests
Install Oracle Database Instance Client, Update bashrc and Clone the Python SDK

```
# on oci github:
bash -c "$(curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oracle/oci-python-sdk/master/examples/usage_reports_to_adw/setup/setup_packages.ol8.sh)"
```

## 7. Setup Credentials

This script will ask for Database Name, Admin Password, Application Password and Extract Start Date

```
/home/opc/usage_reports_to_adw/setup/setup_credentials.sh
```
   
## 8. Download Autonomous database Wallet

```
# on Linux -> create folder $HOME/ADWCUSG
mkdir $HOME/ADWCUSG

# On OCI -> MENU -> Autonomous Data Warehouse -> ADWCUSG
--> Service Console
--> Administration
--> Download Client Credential
--> Specify the Admin Password
--> Copy the Wallet wallet.zip to the Linux folder /home/opc with the name wallet.zip
```

## 9. Check OCI Connectivity and setup database users and apex

```
# Execute:
/home/opc/usage_reports_to_adw/setup/setup_usage2adw.sh
   
```

## 10. Open Autonomous Database APEX Workspace Admin

```
OCI Console -> Autonomous Databases -> ADWCUSG -> Service Console
Development Menu -> Oracle APEX
Choose Workspace Login.

Workspace = Usage
User = Usage
Password = Password you defined for the application
```

## 11. Login to Apex Application

```
    Press on App Builder on the Left side
    Press on the application "Usage and Cost Report"
    Execute the application
    Bookmark this page for future use

    User = Usage
    Password = Password you defined for the application

```
