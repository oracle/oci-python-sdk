# Usage2ADW - Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Usage and Cost Reports to Autonomous Database with APEX Reporting

## Step by Step Manual installation Guide on OCI VM and Autonomous Data Warehouse Database
usage2adw is a tool which uses the Python SDK to extract the usage reports from your tenant and load it to Oracle Autonomous Database.

Oracle Application Express (APEX) will be used for reporting.  

**Developed by Adi Zohar, Feb 2020**

** DISCLAIMER â€“ This is not an official Oracle application **

## 1. Deploy VM Compute instance to run the python script
```
   OCI -> Menu -> Compute -> Instances
   Create Instance
   --> Name = UsageVM
   --> Image = Oracle Linux 7
   --> Shape = VM.Standard2.1
   --> Choose your network VCN and Subnet (any type of VCN and Subnet)
   --> Assign public IP -  Optional if on public subnet
   --> Add your public SSH key
   --> Press Create
```

```
   Copy Instance Info:
   --> Compute OCID to be used for Dynamic Group Permission
   --> Compute IP
```

## 2. Create Dynamic Group for Instance Principles

```
   OCI -> Menu -> Identity -> Dynamic Groups -> Create Dynamic Group
   --> Name = UsageDownloadGroup 
   --> Desc = Dynamic Group for the Usage Report VM
   --> Rule 1 = ANY { instance.id = 'OCID_Of_Step_1_Instance' }
```

## 3. Create Policy to allow the Dynamic Group to extract usage report and read Compartments

```
   OCI -> Menu -> Identity -> Policies
   Choose Root Compartment
   Create Policy
   --> Name = UsageDownloadPolicy
   --> Desc = Allow Dynamic Group UsageDownloadGroup to Extract Usage report script
   Statements:
   define tenancy usage-report as ocid1.tenancy.oc1..aaaaaaaaned4fkpkisbwjlr56u7cj63lf3wffbilvqknstgtvzub7vhqkggq
   endorse dynamic-group UsageDownloadGroup to read objects in tenancy usage-report
   Allow dynamic-group UsageDownloadGroup to inspect compartments in tenancy
   Allow dynamic-group UsageDownloadGroup to inspect tenancies in tenancy
   *** Please don't change the usage report tenant OCID, it is fixed.
```

## 4. Deploy Autonomous Data Warehouse Database

```
   OCI -> Menu -> Autonomous Data Warehouse
   Create Autonomous Database
   --> Compartment = Please Choose
   --> Display Name = ADWCUSG
   --> Database Name ADWCUSG
   --> Workload = Data Warehouse
   --> Deployment = Shared
   --> Always Free = Optional
   --> OCPU = 1
   --> Storage = 1
   --> Auto Scale = No
   --> Password = We1lc2om3e#4 (Please choose your own password)
   --> Choose Network Access = Allow secure Access from Everywhere (you can use VCN as well which requires NSG)
   --> Choose License Type
```

## 5. Login to Linux Machine

```
   Using the SSH key you provided, SSH to the linux machine from step #1
   ssh opc@UsageVM
```

## 6. Run Install Packages Script from Github

The script will install Python3, Git and python packages - oci, oci-cli, cx_Oracle and requests
Install Oracle Database Instance Client, Update bashrc and Clone the Python SDK
```
   # on oci github:
   bash -c "$(curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oracle/oci-python-sdk/master/examples/usage_reports_to_adw/setup/setup_packages.sh)"
```

## 7. Setup Credentials

This script will ask for Database Name, Admin Password, Application Password and Extract Start Date

```
   /home/opc/usage_reports_to_adw/setup/setup_credentials.sh
```
   
## 8. Download Autonomous database Wallet

```
   # on Linux -> create folder $HOME/ADWCUSG
   mkdir $HOME/ADWCUSG

   # On OCI -> MENU -> Autonomous Data Warehouse -> ADWCUSG
   --> Service Console
   --> Administration
   --> Download Client Credential
   --> Specify the Admin Password
   --> Copy the Wallet wallet_ADWCUSG.zip to the Linux folder /home/opc with the name wallet.zip
```

## 9. Check OCI Connectivity and setup database users and apex

```
   # Execute:
   /home/opc/usage_reports_to_adw/setup/setup_usage2adw.sh
   
```

## 10. Open Autonomous Database APEX Workspace Admin

```
    OCI Console -> Autonomous Databases -> ADWCUSG -> Service Console
    Development Menu -> Oracle APEX
    Choose Workspace Login.

    Workspace = Usage
    User = Usage
    Password = Password you defined for the application


```

## 11. Login to Apex Application

```
    Press on App Builder on the Left side
    Press on the application "Usage and Cost Report"
    Execute the application
    Bookmark this page for future use

    User = Usage
    Password = Password you defined for the application

```
