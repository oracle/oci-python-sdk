# This script provides a basic example of how to use the Email Service in the Python SDK. This script accepts two
# will demonstrate:
#
#   * Creating, retrieving, moving, listing and deleting email senders
#   * Creating, retrieving, listing and deleting email suppressions
#   * Obtaining SMTP credentials for your IAM user so that you can send emails.
#     See https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Email/Tasks/configuresmtpconnection.htm for more
#     information on sending emails
#
# This script accepts four arguments:
#
#   * The compartment ID where email senders will be created
#   * The target compartment ID where email senders will be moved to
#   * The address of the email sender
#   * The address of the email suppression
#
# Note that email senders are created in the compartment which you specify, but the suppressions are always created at the tenancy
# level. The tenancy will be read from your configuration file.
