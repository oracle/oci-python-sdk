# This script provides a basic example of how to upload and delete an API key
# using the Python SDK.
#
# This script accepts one argument:
#
#   * The path to the public API key to upload.
#
# The script relies on having a config file for the other variables.
# More information on the config file can be found here:
#    https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/API/Concepts/sdkconfig.htm
#
# Note, you must already have an API key associated with your user to call the
# APIs so this example shows you how to add a second key, or you could create
# a new user and use the steps here to upload a key to that user.
#
# More information on Keys and API Signing can be found here:
#    https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/API/Concepts/apisigningkey.htm
