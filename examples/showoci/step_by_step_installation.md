## 1. Deploy VM Compute instance to run the python script
```
   OCI -> Menu -> Compute -> Instances
   Create Instance
   --> Name = ShowOCIVM
   --> Image = Oracle Linux 7
   --> Shape = VM.Standard2.1 (Free Micro can be used as well)
   --> Choose your network VCN and Subnet (any type of VCN and Subnet)
   --> Assign public IP -  Optional if on public subnet
   --> Add your public SSH key
   --> Press Create
```

```
   Copy Instance Info:
   --> Compute OCID to be used for Dynamic Group Permission
   --> Compute IP
```

## 2. Create Dynamic Group for Instance Principles

```
   OCI -> Menu -> Identity -> Dynamic Groups -> Create Dynamic Group
   --> Name = ShowOCIDynamicGroup 
   --> Desc = Dynamic Group for the showoci VM
   --> Rule 1 = ANY { instance.id = 'OCID_Of_Step_1_Instance' }
```

## 3. Create Policy to allow the Dynamic Group to run showoci report

```
   OCI -> Menu -> Identity -> Policies
   Choose Root Compartment
   Create Policy
   --> Name = showociPolicy
   --> Desc = Allow Dynamic Group ShowOCIDynamicGroup to extract tenant information using showoci
   --> Statement = allow dynamic-group ShowOCIDynamicGroup to read all-resources in tenancy
   
```

## 4. Login to Linux Machine

```
   Using the SSH key you provided, SSH to the linux machine from step #1
   ssh opc@UsageVM
```

## 5. Install Python 3, GIT and OCI packages

```
   sudo yum install -y python3 git
   sudo pip3 install --upgrade oci oci-cli 

   # test instance principle is working using oci-cli
   oci os ns get --auth instance_principal
   
   [opc@ShowOCIVM ~]$ oci os ns get --auth instance_principal
   {
       "data": "orasenatdplxxxx"
   }
```

## 6. Clone the OCI SDK Repo from Git Hub

```
   git clone https://github.com/oracle/oci-python-sdk
```

## 7. Execute the python script - showoci.py

```
    cd oci-python-sdk/examples/showoci
    python3 showoci.py -ip -ani
```
