            #        need to look at all compartments as a RESERVED public IP may be in a different compartment
            #        to the private IP: https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Network/Tasks/managingpublicIPs.htm
            #
            #   (F2) Lazily retrieve the public IP used by the private IP address (if any) by individual calls to
            #        get_public_ip_by_private_ip_id
            #
            # Each has drawbacks and benefits, but the one you choose will vary by use case and how you have set up your
            # Oracle Cloud Infrastructure resources. For example, if you have many secondary private IPs then (F2) may result
            # in substantially more service calls than (F1); however for (F1) your user needs permissions to list these resources
            # across multiple compartments and you may also be retrieving redundant data. Depending on how many "things" you
            # are looking for, there is also the potential under (F1) for the data to have become stale, whereas there is no such
            # issue for (F2) because you're always getting that data at the current point in time (however, even in that case under
            # (F1) the more up-to-date data would likely be captured in a subsequent run of this script/example).
