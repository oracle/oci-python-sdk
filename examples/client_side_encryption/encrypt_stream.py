# Instructions:
# As a pre-requisite for this example you must have a vault created in KMS with at least one master key.
# OCI KMS has APIs that allow creating master keys or importing a previously generated key, either will work.
# You can refer to the example at examples/kms_example.py for an example of how to create a master key.
# Update the values for VAULT_ID and MASTER_KEY_ID below with the values for your vault and key and then run
# the example.

import shutil
import filecmp

import oci

# TODO: populate variables below
VAULT_ID = ""
MASTER_KEY_ID = ""

# load default configuration from ~/.oci/config
config = oci.config.from_file()

# if you want to target a region other than the one specified
# in your config, you must override 'region' in the config
# before initializing the MasterKey and MasterKeyProvider
config['region'] = 'us-phoenix-1'
