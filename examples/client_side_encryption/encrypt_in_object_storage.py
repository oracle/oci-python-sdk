# Instructions:
# As a pre-requisite for this example you must have a vault created in KMS with at least one master key.
# OCI KMS has APIs that allow creating master keys or importing a previously generated key, either will work.
# You can refer to the example at examples/kms_example.py for an example of how to create a master key.
# Update the values for VAULT_ID and MASTER_KEY_ID below with the values for your vault and key and then run
# the example.
# Also update BUCKET_NAME to a bucket in your tenancy that can be used for the upload / download encrypted object
# portion of the sample.
