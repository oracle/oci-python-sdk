        When an Oracle Bare Metal Cloud Services or virtual machine

        If you want more control over the boot process, you can provide
        your own custom iPXE script that will run when the instance boots;
        however, you should be aware that the same iPXE script will run
        every time an instance boots; not only after the initial
        LaunchInstance call.

        The default iPXE script connects to the instance\u2019s local boot
        volume over iSCSI and performs a network boot. If you use a custom iPXE
        script and want to network-boot from the instance\u2019s local boot volume
        over iSCSI the same way as the default iPXE script, you should use the
